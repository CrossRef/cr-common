# cr-common
This project is intended to be shared across modules developed collaboratively.  It was started as a resut of a integrating
the reference matching module into the CS codebase. In an effort to enhance that effort, generic functionality was abstracted
from that project and placed in this repository, which is now a dependency of the reference matching module.

As other modules are developed, the idea is that similar, common utility classes and components can be be placed here so that
common development efforts can leverage a common, growing code base.
